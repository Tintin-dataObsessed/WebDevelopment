            <h3>My Projects include: </h3>
            <h4>Client data extraction and analysis</h4>
            <p>I was tasked to extract data on agricultural trends in the UK from TRACES. I had to collect import and export data on organic goods<br>
            I would use Excel to data clean and power Query to manipulate and break it down.I created graphs and interactive charts for the client on Power Bi<br></p>
            <hr>
            <h4> Data scraping and Incremental loading in VBA</h4>
            <p>I needed to create a way to get automatic forex rates for a client and have a table that would automatically add multiple Exchange rates daily which would then be sourced into a dashboard<br>
                I could not use Power Query and the Append does not have an incremental load function where the table can increase and adjust overtime with out intervention. Using VBA, and CLI I created a batch file and instructed the Excel file to execute the batch file on my computer<br>
                This means the VBA has access to task scheduler and can open the Excel, load the rates and close it a set times.
            <br> I was very proud of this project as it required me to think outside of the box</p>

            <h4> Loan Prediction in Python</h4>
            <p>I created a way to predict the likability of attaining a loan through python.<br>
                Extracting data from Kaggle I was able use the individual's credit scores and a number of factors such as dependents, collateral, etc to predict wether they would get a bank loan.</p>
