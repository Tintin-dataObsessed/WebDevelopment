Creating a Responsive Telemedicine Webpage<br>

This project is a responsive telemedicine web application designed to connect patients with healthcare providers virtually. The goal was to develop a responsive webpage that adapts to various screen sizes.The flexible layout will use HTML, CSS, and media queries.
The webpage includes a header, a navigation bar, a main body, a sidebar, and a footer. The layout should be flexible and rearrange itself to optimize usability across different screen sizes.

### Structure:

Header: Contains the title of the webpage and a logo.
Navigation Bar: Includes links to different sections/pages.
Main Content Area: A section that displays the main content.
Sidebar: A sidebar with additional links, a search bar, or any other relevant information.
Footer: Includes copyright information, social media links, and contact details.

### Design:
Uses a flexible grid system/Flexbox for the layout.
Including CSS media queries to make the webpage responsive.
Ensure the layout adjusts smoothly when the screen size changes.
The navigation bar should convert into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
The sidebar can either collapse or move below the main content on mobile devices.
Use appropriate margins, padding, and typography to enhance readability and aesthetics.
